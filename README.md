mkflickr
========

An exercise in using GRUNT, and following current methods of development for personal skills growth. Feel free to fork what is here so far.

**mkflickr** is a jquery plugin to build a pretty gallery of images based on a users Flickr userID. **Please note**, you need a [Flickr developers API key] (http://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/apply/) to use this plugin.
