mkflickr
========

mkFlickr is my first GitHub project, for personal improvement, investigating Github, GRUNT, and other modern JS development techniques. mkFlickr is a simple jQuery plugin to render a simple Flickr gallery based on a user's id. 

This branch is for the github pages that support the repo
